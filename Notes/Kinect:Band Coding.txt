Kinect/Band Coding


Kinect
    KinectSensor class

    Windows operating system required
    Requires VisualStudio
    C# or Javascript/HTML
        Downfall Javascript/HTML is a little slower
        Upside easier to code
    C#
        this.sensor = KinectSensor.GetDefault90;
        this.sensor.Open();
            BLAHHHH
        this.sensor.Close();

    Gesture Recognition
    Heuristic
        Gesture is a coding problem
        Quick to do simple gestures/poses
        ML can also be useful to find good signals for Heuristic approach
    Machine Learning with G.B.
        Gesture is a data problem
        Signals which may not be easily human understandable (progress in a baseball swing)
        Large investment for production
        Record several clips of people going through various movements
            Then go to clips and Gesture Recognition and tag the clips (annotate)
            ML uses those annotations to refine its analysis
        Danger of over-fitting, causes you to be too specific eliminating recognition of generic cases
